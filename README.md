## Claude API Integration

The application uses the official Claude API to generate authentic AI artwork. Claude receives detailed prompts about:
- Art styles (abstract, nature, geometric, etc.)
- Color themes (vibrant, pastel, cosmic, etc.)
- Creative constraints for 64x64 pixel space

Claude responds with:
- A creative title for each artwork
- A description of the piece
- A complete 64x64 pixel array with color data

## Demo Mode

If you don't have a Claude API key, the application runs in demo mode with sophisticated simulated AI that creates:
- Complex spiral and wave patterns
- Fractal-inspired designs
- Symmetrical compositions
- Advanced color palettes
- Creative titles and descriptions

## Art Styles Generated by Claude

Claude creates diverse artwork including:
- **Abstract Geometric**: Complex mathematical patterns and shapes
- **Nature Landscapes**: Pixelated scenes of natural beauty
- **Minimalist Portraits**: Simple yet expressive human forms
- **Psychedelic Mandalas**: Intricate circular designs
- **Retro Pixel Art**: Nostalgic gaming-inspired scenes
- **Surreal Dreamscapes**: Imaginative and otherworldly compositions
- **Architectural Studies**: Geometric building and structure designs
- **Botanical Illustrations**: Detailed plant and flower patterns
- **Cosmic Phenomena**: Space and celestial body representations
- **Urban Cityscapes**: City and architectural pixel art

## Technical Details

- **Canvas Size**: 64x64 grid (512x512 pixels display)
- **Storage**: Uses browser localStorage for persistent artwork storage (keeps last 50 artworks)
- **Timer**: 10-minute intervals for automatic generation
- **API**: Claude 3 Sonnet model via Anthropic API
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with Canvas API support
- **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
